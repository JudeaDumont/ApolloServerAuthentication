npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

the guy did not includ confirmPassword in the

input RegisterInput {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    password: String
}

in typedefs. And to make sure it actually gets into type defs, you have to close the client project

then close the wrapping project

then rerun the wrapping project, and then rerun the client project.

this tutorial sucks.
